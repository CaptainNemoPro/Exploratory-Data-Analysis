# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

If you have a passion for cars and an affinity for data, you've come to the right place. I've selected a dataset on car prices for this project and utilized Python libraries to create visualizations that enhance our understanding of the data. Before delving into the insights, it's important to have a solid grasp of the data variables. Although the CSV file is already included in this project, I'll provide a brief overview of the dataset.

# About the dataset.

The dataset contains a compilation of different car models accompanied by their respective names, alongside comprehensive information on each car model, including details such as fuel type, number of doors, car body, wheelbase, car length, engine type, and other relevant specifications. While the majority of the variables in this dataset are numerical, there are also a few categorical ones.

# Users of this dataset

This tool can be useful for various purposes, such as helping an automobile company to assess the specifications of its competitors' cars, allowing car enthusiasts to compare the specifications of different car models, or aiding a new company in comprehending the intricacies of the automobile market.

1. A correlation exists between wheelbase and carlength, such that longer cars require a broader wheelbase. Thus, when designing longer cars, it is important to keep in mind that the wheelbase should also be made wider and vice versa.

2. The histograms of engine size and horsepower are nearly identical, indicating a positive correlation between the two. This means that customers seeking a high horsepower vehicle should opt for a car with a larger engine, which will come at a higher cost.

3. Sedan and hatchback car body types are more popular, possibly due to their lower cost compared to other car body types. This suggests that customers may be price sensitive.

4. The larger the engine size, the more expensive the vehicle. This is because a larger engine size typically results in higher horsepower, meaning that engine size and horsepower are positively correlated.

5. Gasoline-powered cars are preferred over diesel-powered cars by most customers. This suggests that the market may be dominated by customers looking for affordable cars rather than luxury ones.

6. Sedan cars are the most preferred by the majority of customers, while convertible cars are the least preferred.

# Conclusion 

I hope you have reviewed the visualizations and read this file up to this point. Our project examined how car prices can vary based on various parameters, not just one. When producing a car model, manufacturers must carefully analyze its specifications to determine its demand and overall price. I hope you gained valuable insights from a car manufacturer's perspective and enjoyed reading this work. Thank you for viewing it.
